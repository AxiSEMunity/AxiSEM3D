#  This is an AxiSEM3D input parameter file for
#  the Nr field: Nr = Nr(s,z)
#  s:  horizontal coordinate in the 2D mesh
#  z:  vertical coordinate in the 2D mesh
#  Nr: the azimuthal resolution of solution, i.e., the number of
#      "cardinal points" along the "ring" generated by rotating the
#      point (s,z) around the axis by 2π; Nu = Nr/2 is the Fourier
#      expansion order of solution at (s,z)

##################### pointwise #####################
# parameters for type_Nr = POINTWISE
pointwise:
    # what: netcdf data file
    # type: filename
    # note: 1) this file must contain the following two variables:
    #          * pointwise_sz, double, (X, 2), (s,z) of X control points
    #          * pointwise_Nr, int,    (X, ),  Nr at the X control points
    #       2) the unit is meter for s and z
    #       3) interpolation is based on inverse distance weighting
    #       4) another variable starting_Nr_for_scanning will exist if
    #          this file has been created by wavefield scanning
    nc_data_file: pointwise.nc

    # what: factor multiplied to Nr(s,z)
    # type: double
    # note: useful if nc_data_file was created by wavefield scanning;
    #       for example, Nr(s,z) obtained by scanning s20rts may be
    #       applied to s40rts by using a factor of 2.0
    multip_factor: 1.


##################### structured #####################
# parameters for type_Nr = STRUCTURED
structured:
    # what: netcdf data file
    # type: filename
    # note: 1) for a Cartesian mesh, this file must contain three variables:
    #          * structured_s,  double, (M, ),  s of M grid points
    #          * structured_z,  double, (N, ),  z of N grid points
    #          * structured_Nr, int,    (M, N), Nr at the M*N grid points
    #       2) for a sphercial mesh, replace (_s, _z) with (_r, _t), t for θ
    #       3) the unit is meter for s, z and r and radian for θ

##################### wavefield scanning #####################
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Q: What is wavefield scanning?
# A: AxiSEM3D "learns" a sub-optimal Nr(s,z) during a simulation and
#    dump the resultant Nr(s,z) into a file, which can be re-used in
#    subsequent simulations with similar input parameters, such as
#    similar (or simpler) 3D models, source depth and record length.
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Q: How wavefield scanning works?
# A: Starting from the current Nr(s,z), AxiSEM3D analyzes the Fourier
#    series of the wavefield at any mesh point upon the arrival of an
#    energy peak (measured in H2-norm) and determines if any "small"
#    higher-order terms can be truncated away; at the end of the
#    simulation, the required Nr (maximum over time) is dumped to file.
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Q: How to enable wavefield scanning?
# A: Setting enable_scanning = true. The starting (current) Nr(s,z) can be
#    any of {CONSTANT, ANALYTICAL, POINTWISE, STRUCTURED}. The resultant
#    Nr(s,z) will be no greater than the starting Nr(s,z).
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Q: How to re-use Nr(s,z) obtained by scanning?
# A: Use type_Nr = POINTWISE, setting nc_data_file to the output file
#    of wavefield scanning (after moving it from output/ to input/).
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    # what: output file
    # type: filename
    output_file: scanning_output_Nr.nc

    # what: relative threshold for the convergence of Fourier series
    # type: double
    # note: 1) this parameter represents the accuracy loss by truncating
    #          the Fourier series of the wavefield
    #       2) allowed range: [1e-4, 1e-1]
    threshold_Fourier_convergence: 1e-2
    
    # what: relative amplitude skipped for scanning
    # type: double
    # note: 1) an energy peak with an amplitude smaller than
    #          "this relative amplitude * the largest energy peak"
    #          will be skipped for scanning
    #       2) using 1. means that the resultant Nr accounts only for
    #          the largest energy peak across the record length
    #       3) using 0. means that the resultant Nr accounts for all
    #          the energy peaks across the record length
    #       4) allowed range: [0., 1.]

        vertex_only: true

        # what: how many time steps per mesh period to detect energy peaks
