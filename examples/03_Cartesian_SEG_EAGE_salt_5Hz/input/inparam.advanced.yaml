#  advanced settings


##################### verbosity #####################
# parameters for verbosity
verbose:
    # what: verbose to stdout or a file
    # type: string
    # only: STDOUT / filename
    channel: STDOUT

    # what: verbosity level
    # type: string
    # only: NONE / ESSENTIAL / DETAILED
    level: DETAILED

    # what: show/hide runtime warnings
    # type: bool
    warnings: true

    # what: time step interval to display time loop info
    # type: int
    loop_info_interval: 1000

    # what: time step interval for stability check
    # type: int
    # note: use 1 to precisely locate the origin of instability
    stability_interval: 1


##################### mpi #####################
# parameters for mpi
mpi:
    # what: number of processors in a mpi group
    # type: int
    # note: 1) AxiSEM3D uses a two-level MPI structure where the
    #          processors are divided into groups to avoid broadcasting
    #          a large input dataset (e.g., the Exodus mesh or a large
    #          3D model) on every processor; instead, a large dataset can
    #          be stored only on a "leader" processor in each group, which
    #          handles data requests from its members
    #       2) increase this number (from 1 to the number of processors per
    #          per node) to save memory
    nproc_per_group: 24
    
    # what: weight for load balancing
    # type: string
    # only: ELEMENT / ELEMENT_POINT
    # note: 1) ELEMENT:       use cost measurement on elements
    #       2) ELEMENT_POINT: use cost measurement on both elements and points
    weight_for_load_balancing: ELEMENT_POINT

    # what: plot domain decomposition
    # type: bool
    # note: the output netcdf file contains three variables:
    #       * coords,   double, (X, 2), (s,z) of the element centers
    #       * mpi_rank, int,    (X, ),  mpi rank of the elements
    #       * weights,  double, (X, ),  element weights for decomposition
    #       where X is the number of elements
    plot_domain_decomposition: false


##################### developers #####################
# parameters for developers
develop:
    # what: enable/disable preloop diagnosis
    # type: bool
    # note: 1) output/develop/preloop_diagnosis.log for runtime and memory
    #       2) output/develop/cost_measurements.log for cost measurements
    #          on elements and GLL points
    diagnose_preloop: true

    # what: maximum time steps for running
    # type: int
    # note: use 0 to free this limit
    max_num_time_steps: 0

    # what: wall-clock time limit (sec) for FFTW planning
    # type: double
    time_limit_for_fftw_planning: 60.

    # what: enforce FFTW lucky numbers
    # type: bool
    # note: FFTW is good at handling logical sizes of the form:
    #       n = (2^a)*(3^b)*(5^c)*(7^d)*(11^e)*(13^f), where e + f < 2,
    #       as called the lucky numbers; users should use true.
    fftw_lucky_numbers: true
