#  This is an AxiSEM3D input parameter file for
#  1D and 3D models


############################# 1D model #############################
# parameters for 1D model (the mesh)
model1D:
    # what: Exodus mesh file created by salvus mesher
    # type: filename
    exodus_mesh: local_mesh__SEG_salt__5Hz.e


############################# geodesy #############################
# parameters for geodesy
geodesy:
    # what: geographic location of the north pole in the mesh
    # type: array of double / SOURCE
    # note: 1) this reference location enables the usage of geographic
    #          coordinates for locating sources, receivers and 3D models,
    #          compatible with Cartesian meshes
    #       2) array of double: [latitude, longitude]
    #       3) SOURCE: determined this location by the FIRST source
    #                  presented in list_of_sources in inparam.source.yaml;
    #                  always use SOURCE for a single-source simulation
    lat_lon_north_pole_mesh: SOURCE

    # what: flattening on the surface
    # type: string / double
    # only: SPHERE / WGS84 / GRS80 / SPECFEM3D_GLOBE / value
    # note: 1) ellipticity is ignored for a Cartesian mesh
    #       2) 0 for a perfect sphere; ~0.0033 for the Earth
    #       3) ellipticity will be used in the transformation between
    #          the geographic and the geocentric co-latitudes;
    #          see eq. (14.32) in Dahlen & Tromp, 1998
    #       4) to actually deform the entire mesh, add 3D model
    #          "Ellipticity" to list_of_3D_models
    flattening_on_surface: WGS84


######################## absorbing boundary ########################
# parameters for absorbing boundary condition
absorbing_boundary:
    # what: model boundaries regarded as absorbing boundaries
    # type: array of string
    # only: a subset of [RIGHT, BOTTOM, TOP]
    # note: 1) an AxiSEM3D mesh may contain four outer boundaries:
    #          left (axial), right, bottom and top (surface); the right,
    #          bottom and top ones can be absorbing boundaries (the left
    #          or axial one is non-physical)
    #       2) use [] to disable absorbing boundary condition
    #          (so that all model boundaries will be stress-free)
    #       3) the most common case in seismology is [RIGHT, BOTTOM]
    boundaries: [RIGHT, BOTTOM]
    
    # what: enable the Clayton-Enquist approach
    # type: bool
    # note: the simplest linear approach by Clayton & Engquist (1977)
    enable_Clayton_Enquist: true
    
    # the sponge approach by Kosloff & Kosloff (1986)
    Kosloff_Kosloff:
        # what: enable the Kosloff-Kosloff approach
        # type: bool
        # note: Clayton-Enquist and Kosloff-Kosloff can be used together,
        #       but one of them has to be enabled at least
        enable: true
        
        # what: relative spans of the sponge layers
        # type: array of double
        # note: 1) must be presented in the same order as absorbing_boundaries
        #       2) to use Kosloff-Kosloff, the mesh should be a little larger
        #          than the required computational domain; for example, given
        #          a required domain spans from 0 to 100 km in depth, one can
        #          generate a mesh from 0 to 110 km and set the relative span
        #          to 0.05, so the thickness of the sponge layer at the mesh
        #          bottom will be determined as 110 * 0.05 = 5.5 km, leaving
        #          an unaffected depth range from 0 to 104.5 km for normal
        #          wave propagation and analysis
        #          allowed range: .01 ~ 0.25
        relative_spans: [.05, .05]
        
        # what: U0's of the sponge layers
        # type: array of double
        # note: 1) must be presented in the same order as absorbing_boundaries
        #       2) U0 represents the attenuation strength on the outermost edge
        #          of a sponge layer (i.e., on the mesh boundary); moving away
        #          from the outermost edge, such a strength gradually decreases
        #          and finally vanishes on the the innermost edge
        #          allowed range: .01 ~ 0.25
        U0: [.1, .1]


######################## attenuation ########################
# what: attenuation mode
# type: string
# only: NONE / FULL / CG4
# note: 1) NONE: turn off attenuation
#       2) FULL: compute attenuation on all GLL points
#       3) CG4:  compute attenuation on 4 GLL points per element;
#                CG4 is mostly as accurate as FULL but more efficient
#                than FULL, see van Driel & Nissen-​Meyer, 2014;
#                CG4 requires set(NPOL 4) in CMakeLists.txt;
attenuation: NONE


############################# 3D models #############################
# what: list of 3D models
# type: array of objects
# note: 1) the order in this list can affect the final 3D model
#       2) use [] if no 3D model presents
list_of_3D_models: []
