"sim1_ani_prem_mesh ":
Contains the input for a 50s simulation using an anisotropic PREM mesh (created with salvus).
"sim2_iso_prem_mesh_plus_ani":
Contains the input for a 50s simulation for an isotropic PREM mesh.
Anisotropy is added later, reproducing ani PREM anisotropy.
The anisotropic netcdf input is created in "processing/Cijkl_for_ani_PREM".
The folder contains all the files necessary to repeat this exercise.

After lowpass filtering, the seismograms from both simulations are identical.
