"ani_prem_mesh":
Contains a 5s simulation for an anisotropic PREM mesh (created with salvus).
"iso_prem_mesh_plus_ani":
Contains a 5s simulation for an isotropic PREM mesh.
Anisotropy was added later, reproducing ani PREM anisotropy.
The anisotropic netcdf input was created in "processing/Cijkl_for_ani_PREM".
The folder contains all the files necessary to repeat this exercise.

After lowpass filtering, the seismograms from both simulations are identical.
