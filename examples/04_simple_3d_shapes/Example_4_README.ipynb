    "This example is designed to highlight the flexibility of AxiSEM-3D to incorporating different geometric shapes into both cartesian and global simulations. Introduction of sphere's or ellipsoids, for example, may be used to study wave scattering, while cylinders and slabs may be used to in studies regarding tectonic structures like plumes or subducting material. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here I provide three examples: \n",
    "1) Single sphere in small 3D cartesian grid  \n",
    "2) Multiple distributed spheres in a 3D cartesian grid \n",
    "3) A plume head and tail in a global simulation \n",
    "\n",
    "The release paper features a slightly more complex version of Example 3. This can be found in the [AxiSEM3D Further Examples](https://github.com/AxiSEMunity/AxiSEM3D-further-examples/tree/main/examples) Github repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Please note that in these examples I use a very low $n_r$ number (either 1 or 5). This makes the simulations much faster but NOT accurate. In these cases it doesnt really matter but if you want a realistic simulation then high $n_r$ is the way to go!*\n",
