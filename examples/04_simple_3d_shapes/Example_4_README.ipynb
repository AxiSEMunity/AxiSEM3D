    "This example is designed to highlight the flexibility of AxiSEM3D to incorporating different geometric shapes into both cartesian and global simulations. Introduction of sphere's or ellipsoids, for example, may be used to study wave scattering, while cylinders and slabs may be used to in studies regarding tectonic structures like plumes or subducting material. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here I provide four examples: \n",
    "1) Single sphere in small 3D cartesian grid  \n",
    "2) Multiple distributed spheres in a 3D cartesian grid \n",
    "3) A plume head and tail in a global simulation \n",
    "4) An example used in the release paper for AxiSEM3D (DOI: ... )\n",
    "\n",
    "*Please note that in Examples 1-3 I use a very low $n_r$ number (either 1 or 5). This makes the simulations much faster but NOT accurate. In these cases it doesnt really matter but if you want a realistic simulation then high $n_r$ is the way to go!*\n",

Everything related to this example may be found in the `example_release_paper` directory. Steps to reproduce Figure ... are listed below: \n",

    "1. To generate the 3D `NetCDF` model, you should run the python script `generate_3D_model.py`, e.g.\n",

    "    *Note here that although this script can generate a new, random model of ellipsoids, it is set here to read values from the file `randomblobs` such that the `NetCDF` file utilised in the release paper example can be reproduced exactly. See comments in the file for further details*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. All input files, apart from the 3D model (.nc file) are provided in `example_release_paper/inputs`. These files should be added to your `input` directory of the AxiSEM3D build before simulation. \n",
    "3. Run simulation. Depending on the resources available it may take a few hours! \n",
    "4. Download the `output/Stations/Station_1/` data into the `example_release_paper/datas` directory and run the plotting script.\n",
