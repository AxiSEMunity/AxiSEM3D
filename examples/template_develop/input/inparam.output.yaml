############################# station-wise #############################
# what: list of station groups
# type: array of objects
# note: 1) different options such as channels and sampling rates can
#          be used for different station groups; for example, one may
#          have one group of real-world seismic stations to record the
#          displacement vector at a high sampling rate and another group
#          of animation stations to record only the vertical displacement
#          at a low sampling rate
#       2) use [] if no station group presents
list_of_station_groups: []
