#  This is an AxiSEM3D input parameter file for
#  time-axis and sources


############################# time axis #############################
# parameters for the time axis of the simulation
time_axis:
    # what: record length (the end time in seismograms)
    # type: double
    # note: the start time depends on the source-time functions
    record_length: 1800.

    # what: user-specified Δt
    # type: string / double
    # only: NONE / value
    # note: use NONE to automatically determine Δt by mesh
    enforced_dt: NONE

    # what: the Courant number for determining Δt by mesh
    # type: double
    # note: 1) Δt increases with the Courant number; decrease it when
    #          numerical instability occurs
    #       2) [safe] 0.5 <===> 1.0 [aggressive]; 0.6~0.7 normally works
    #       3) if Courant_number < 0.3 but instability still occurs,
    #          it is likely to be an issue caused by an input 3D model
    #          (e.g., mislocation near a model boundary)
    Courant_number: 0.6

    # what: time integrator
    # type: string
    # only: NEWMARK / SYMPLECTIC
    # note: 1) NEWMARK is faster while SYMPLECTIC is less dispersive
    #       2) use SYMPLECTIC for ultra-long simulations
    #       3) Δt can be larger for SYMPLECTIC than for NEWMARK
    integrator: NEWMARK


######################### sources #########################
# what: list of sources
# type: array of objects
# note: 1) multiple sources are allowed
#       2) use [] if no source presents
list_of_sources: []
